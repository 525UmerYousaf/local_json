        "title": "Second Pixel that broke after 2 years - Terrible customer service",
        "review": "Just broke completely with no reason after 2 years, after my first Pixel broke the same way, after 2 years.Before purchasing it, I believe Google Support told me this model would have a better life, so I naively purchased this newer model.2 years later, here we go again, broken again, I have to spend all this time I don't have to discuss the matter, find a new phone, reinstall everything, and grieve my lost data. No mention to the financial waste for me, and ecological waste for the planet.I reached out to the support team who seemed comprehensive at first. After they failed at helping fixing the problem, they advised me to try to get it repaired somewhere since my warranty expired (I guess phone warranties are so short nowadays as brands are totally aware they sell you crap), or to get a new phone. They gave me a 20% coupon, but I reached out again as I was still concerned about getting one of their phone after the 2 phones I got failed me so bad.The person advised me to get a Pixel 7 \"which will have an improved battery and life\". With the current sale + my coupon, the price would be ~360$. \"Not bad\" he said.Except that when I added the product to the cart and applied the coupon, the sale was removed so the final price was MORE expensive than when I didn't apply a coupon at all.I reached out AGAIN to the support team who after a while told me to contact another team. I contacted this other team today, I have enjoy to waste time with people who are not helpful at all, and a robot like person kept saying \"Sorry - discounts are not stackable\" showing no sign of concerns as the previous team lied to push a customer to purchase a product, and finally shut the conversation after a while.I didn't even ASKED for a coupon the first time, so why a company would send an unusable coupon at the first place, valid to purchase phones only except that if you use it you'll pay a more expensive price than anywhere else?! it's insulting and just shows the lack of consideration of a company for their customers.",

I was nervous about the size of this new phone, but although it's 1.5 lbs more and a bit wider and longer, it's still manageable. I was able to easily add all the apps I needed and adjust all the settings. The finger recognition is excellent so far. I'm excited about the new SOS feature (but I'm guessing all new phones have it now). Battery life doesn't seem great, and I wish the charging cord included was longer, but I'll deal with it. The only real frustration is that all my whatsapp data got lost when transferring to this phone: conversations, pictures and videos. ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜©.In general, though, the phone is easy to use and I'm happy with my choice, so far.",
